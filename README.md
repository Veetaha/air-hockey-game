# Air Hockey Game

This is a project made with C++ and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) 
library as a test in order to apply for a C++ programmer position.

Prerequisites:
* [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/download.html)
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) (development libs)
* [SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) (development libs)
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

Run `bootstrap.sh` in order to generate Visual Studio 2019 `".sln"` and `".vcxproj"` files.
Or use `vendor/premake/premake5.exe` directly with other options to generate other build configuration files.
See available premake5 actions with `premake5 --help` or [here](https://github.com/premake/premake-4.x/wiki/Premake_Quick_Start).
